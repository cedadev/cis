diverse set of gridded and ungridded datasets used across earth sciences. Visit our homepage at www.cistools.net.

A pre-packaged version of CIS is available for installation using conda for 64-bit Linux, Mac OSX and Windows.

Once conda is installed, you can easily install CIS with the following command:

If you don’t already have conda, you must first download and install it.
Anaconda is a free conda package that includes Python and many common scientific and data analysis libraries, and is available here: http://continuum.io/downloads.
